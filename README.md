## üëâ Instructions


(Using SuperSandy? Skip to Step #2)
1. Leave 'First Task 'alone unless you are feeling adventurous ('First Task' only appears when using Sandy or Sandy Pro).

2. Change 'Objective' to some grand and unspecific goal (e.g. "Solve world hunger" or "Plan a career path for me to become an astronaut").

3. Tailor the Objective with additional details, parameters, boundaries, and/or modifiers. Beware that bogging down the Objective too much will negatively influence the output.

4. Activate SuperSandy AI in order to connect Sandy AI to the web. 
     Keep in mind that SuperSandy AI will *not always* outperform Sandy AI.
     Sandy AI is extremely knowledgable on all topics in the universe -- up to 2021. SuperSandy AI, on the other hand, can find up-to-date information but is also slower and more prone to errors. After all, unsupervised internet content isn't 100% reliable. 

## üöÄ Fly Me To The Moon Safely
All prompts and responses feature end-to-end encryption.
I cannot and would not want to see what users do with this tool. It can access the internet, from MY server... So this is Not A Legal Expert's way of minimizing his own liability from potential misuse.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
This web app is so awesome. Really, it is absolutely incredible. The Mona Lisa of AI. If OpenAI API calls weren't so expensive and being billed straight to my credit card, I'd be running a hundred SuperSandy AI perpetual autonomous AI agents for a cornucopia of different purposes. But we live in a society. So, in lieu of that, please have fun with this single one. 

Thanks for being a beta tester!
